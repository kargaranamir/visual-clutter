class Vlc():
    """
    
    Class of two measures of visual clutter (Feature Congestion and Subband Entropy)
    
    Parameters
    ---------- 
    inputImage : gives the input. It can be one of the following 2 things: 1. an RGB image; 2. a string, i.e., file name of an RGB image.
    numlevels : the number of levels.
    contrast_filt_sigma : the sigma (standard deviation) of the center-surround DoG1 filter used for computing the contrast 
    contrast_pool_sigma : the sigma (standard deviation) of this Gaussian window for contrast clutter. Default = 3*filt_sigma. 
    color_pool_sigma : the sigma (standard deviation) of this Gaussian window for color clutter, Defaults to 3.
    
    Methods
    -------
    getClutter_FC: computes Feature Congestion clutter, outputs both a scalar (clutter of the whole image) and a map (local clutter).
    getClutter_SE: computes Subband Entropy clutter, outputs only a scalar.
    colorClutter: computes clutter maps indicating local variability in color
    contrastClutter: computes clutter maps indicating local variability in contrast
    orientationClutter: computes clutter maps indicating local variability in orientation
 
    (Please see individual routines for more info about parameters and outputs.)
